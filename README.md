This project is aimed to create a search system for finding events by the date and place where they take place. It will take the user's filled form into consideration and display the available events on a map of a given by user region. For more details see wiki.

Information about adoptable events will be taken from the eventful.com API, which allows to access their database of different events all over the world by providing an API key. If you want to get yours, please go to https://api.eventful.com/docs.
